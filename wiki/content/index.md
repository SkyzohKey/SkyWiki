# Welcome to The Tox Wiki
Hi there! This is the wiki for _Tox_, a distributed, secure messenger with file transfers, audio and video chat capabilities. Tox isn't complete yet, but we encourage you to [contribute] to help us improve the project.

To navigate this wiki, start at the [sitemap], and work your way down the namespaces to the section or article you're looking for. If you already have an idea about what you're looking for, use the search box at the top right of the page.

Information about editing the wiki, such as the Markdown syntax, can be found in the [wiki] namespace.

**If you want to be able to edit the wiki, please [click here to register] and contact the wiki administrator at <admin@tox.chat>**.

## Users
If you're interested in using Tox, check out the [about] page. Keep in mind that, just like the Tox core library, the clients are not finished, feature complete, or stable. If you encounter bugs or security vulnerabilities while using a particular client, please report them to that client's maintainer, according to the guidelines mentioned in [writing useful bug reports].

## Developers
If you're a developer interested in contributing to either the Tox core library, or any of the clients, check out the [developers] namespace.
