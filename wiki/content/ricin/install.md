### Debian/Ubuntu
On Ubuntu you need to compile ToxCore, Libsodium, and filter_audio by hand. Someone already wrote on how to achieve this, simply follow the guide to [Install ToxCore].

After ToxCore is installed, run the following line to fetch & install the dependencies needed by Ricin to compile/run.

```bash
# Required to build Ricin:
$ apt-get install ninja-build meson valac

# Required by Ricin at runtime:
$ apt-get install gtk+3 libglib2.0-0 libglib2.0-dev \
  libjson-glib-1.0-0 libjson-glib-dev libnotify-dev \
  libsoup-gnome2.4-dev
```

>**Note**: You may have to `sudo` both lines in order to have
them running properly.

### ArchLinux
To install all the Ricin's dependencies, simply write the
following in a shell.

```bash
$ pacman -S meson ninja vala gtk3 toxcore \
  glib2 json-glib libsoup libnotify
```

### Fedora
On Fedora you need to compile ToxCore, Libsodium, and filter_audio by hand. Someone already wrote on how to achieve this, simply follow the guide to [Install ToxCore].

```bash
$ dnf install valac glib2 gtk3 gtk3-devel \
  json-glib libsoup libnotify
```

## Installing Ricin
### Linux
#### ArchLinux
Thanks to [LastAvenger], ArchLinux users can install Ricin via AUR: [ricin-git] / [ricin].  
You simply have to write the following line in a shell:

```bash
# Fetch the source from git, build and install.
$ yaourt -S ricin-git

# Use the latest release (stable), build and install.
$ yatourt -S ricin
```

#### Others Linux
For other systems that doesn't yet have a package you have a to compile and install Ricin from sources. Compiling Ricin is super simple as we use **The Meson Build System** that runs pretty much everywhere.  

Run the following commands in a shell:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/RicinApp/Ricin.git
cd Ricin
make autogen
sudo make install
```

### Windows
Ricin isn't available yet on Windows, anyway this is planed.
